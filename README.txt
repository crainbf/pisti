Pisti (pronounced 'Pishti') is a Turkish card game using a standard 52 card
pack. Here it is played by two players, the computer and one human player.

Cards are dealt to a central pile. The central pile can be captured by a
player with a jack or by matching the value of the previous card. (e.g.
putting a 9 on top of a 9)

In the end, each player accumulates a stack of cards this way. Points are awarded to certain cards and the winner is who accumulated more points overall. 

A detailed description of the game follows. 

Cut 
=====

First, four cards are dealt to Player 1 and to Player 2. Four
more cards are put in the central pile, the last one face upwards. The
remaining 40 cards are put in a stock of undealt cards. If the card facing
upwards is a jack it is returned to the bottom of the central pile and the next card is placed face upwards. (If all cards in the central pile are jacks, all cards are dealt again.)

Play
=====
Player 1 plays the first card. If the card matches the top card of the central pile or is a jack, he takes the pile. Otherwise, it is added to the central pile. 

Then Player 2 plays a card. If the card matches the top card of the central pile or is a jack, he takes the pile. Otherwise, it is added to the central pile. 

If a player takes the pile, the other player will play the next card and start a new central pile.

Once both players have run out of cards in their hand, four more cards are dealt and the game continues. 

When all the cards have run out, the remaining central pile is given to the player who made the last capture. 

Pisti
=====
A pisti occurs when the central pile consists of only one card and that card is matched by the player. For example, the central pile only consists of a 10 and the other player matches that ten. It is not possible to play a pisti at the very beginning as the face-down cards also count. 

Double pistis are awarded when a jack is played on a jack. 

The very last card of the game, just before the scoring cannot score a pisti. 

Scoring
=====
Points are awarded for three different things: getting the majority of the cards, specific cards and playing pisti's. 

This is done the following way: 
- each jack gives 1 point
- each ace gives 1 point
- the 2 of clubs gives 2 points
- the 10 of diamonds gives 3 points
- having the card majority (i.e. 27 or more cards) gives 3 points
- each pisti gives 10 points or in the case of a jack on jack pisti 20 points

Winning
=====
The overall game is won when the first player reaches 151 points overall. If both players pass 151 points in the same game, the player with the higher total wins. 

This version
=====
This version of the Pisti game has been modified (simplified) slightly from the original game.

In particular, the computer - at this point - plays a completely random strategy. It simply chooses the top card in his hand which will be a random card as the card order has been ranom as well. 

At this point the player also has no option to actually make choices and the cards are played randomly for him. 

Development Plan
=====
The following is a rough development plan:
- Displaying before each play the top card of the central pile, their hand and which card is played.
- Allowing the player to actually choose which card of their hand is played

In a second stage, it is planned to make the computer player employ some strategy in his play. 

Finally, it is planned to turn the game into a web application.
